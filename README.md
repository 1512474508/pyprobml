# pyprobml
Python 3 code for the second edition of my book "Machine learning: a probabilistic perspective" (http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/). This is work in progress, so expect rough edges.

## Notebooks

I have created IPython notebooks for each of the chapters. When you open a notebook, there will be a button at the top that says 'Open in colab'. If you click on this, it will start a virtual machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which has nearly all the libraries you will need (e.g., scikit-learn, tensorflow 2, PyTorch) pre-installed. If you select 'GPU' from the 'Runtime' menu at the top of Colab, many examples will run much faster. Furthermore, the whole service is free! Alternatively, you can run these notebooks locally in Jupyter, but then you will have to install the packages yourself (see instructions below).

## Scripts

Many of the figures in the book are generated by these  [scripts](scripts). To execute a script, cd (change directory) to the scripts folder, and then type 'python foo.py'. You can also run each script from inside a Python IDE (like Spyder).
Many of the scripts create plots, which are saved to ../figures.



## Installation

We assume you have installed numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.
(All of these are bundled with [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).)

Some scripts rely on additional libraries, such as the following: 
- [tensorflow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [tensorflow probability](https://www.tensorflow.org/probability)
- [jax](https://github.com/google/jax)
- [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

You also need to define the PYPROBML environment variable.
You can do this by adding the following
line to your .bash_profile file, and then starting a new shell.
```
    export PYPROBML="/Users/kpmurphy/github/pyprobml" # replace with your download location
```
