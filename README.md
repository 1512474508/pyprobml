# pyprobml
Python 3 code for my new book series [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/).
This is work in progress, so expect rough edges.

## Scripts

Many of the figures in the book are generated by these  [scripts](scripts). To execute a script, cd (change directory) to the scripts folder, and then type 'python foo.py'. You can also run each script from inside a Python IDE (like Spyder). Many of the scripts create plots, which are saved to ../figures directory.

## Chapter notebooks

For some of the chapters in the book, there are accompanying Jupyter notebooks that cover some of the material in more detail.
See [this link](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/pml1) for a list.


## Other notebooks

Some examples require a GPU in order to run in a reasonable time, and/or they require installing non-standard software or data. For such cases, 
I have created [Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml/tree/master/notebooks). When you open a notebook, there will be a button at the top that says 'Open in colab'. If you click on this, it will start a virtual machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), running [Colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb),  which has most of the libraries you will need (e.g., scikit-learn, tensorflow 2, JAX) pre-installed. You can select 'GPU' from the 'Runtime' menu at the top of Colab to make things run faster.
